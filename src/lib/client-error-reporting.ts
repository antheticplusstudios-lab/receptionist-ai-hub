/**
 * Client-side (browser) error reporting for React error boundaries.
 *
 * The previous implementation only forwarded to `window.__lovableEvents` /
 * `window.__lovableReportRuntimeError`, globals that exist solely inside the
 * Lovable editor's preview iframe. Outside that iframe — i.e. in every real
 * deployment — those calls were silent no-ops, so nothing was actually
 * reported anywhere.
 *
 * This version always logs to the console (visible in the browser devtools
 * and picked up by any RUM/log-shipping agent you attach later). It is
 * intentionally NOT wired to a server table yet — that belongs with the
 * platform's real Security/Operations audit + error-tracking work
 * (see roadmap.md), not bolted on here as a half-implementation.
